# VR-Classroom
A VR application that allows students to watch streams of university lectures and interact with professors.

The app supports both student and professor users. Professors can set up and record lectures/session, ask questions, and receive responses from students. Students can send responses and choose lectures to watch.

Our app uses the TokBox API for live video chat and viewing. It was a small project and a top contender for the 2018 UCSC hackathon CruzHacks.
=======
Coursierge aims to tackle an ongoing social and technical challenge of providing education to students who are unable to attend lectures under any circumstances. Many students find themselves unable to attend lectures due to an illness, lack of transport, or more personal reasons. With Coursierge, any student can continue to receive top quality education from their professors from the comforts of any room with the support of VR.
